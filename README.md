## MyReads Project Description

[This project app](https://my-reads-sewquuiczv.now.sh) is a good example of using `Pure React`. what's more, in this app, I had heavily used the [new Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (rather than choosing [Redux](https://redux.js.org)) which I found quit useful and convenient.

I made all components under [React Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html) but warning messages always appears since the [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) itself didn't come up updating with the new react lifecycle.

Finally, this project is developed at the foundation of [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) which is very helpful. I had done my best to optimize the major part codes and made it more simple and readable.
